# KeurigParticleIo
Code to Automate a Keurig Using a ParticleIo Photon and Integrate with SmartThings. This will allow you to tun your Keurig on and more importantly off using SmartThings Geofencing as the heater is active as long as the Keurig is on.


Notes:

Tested on Keurig K40, which has a LCD screen and 3 brew buttons, and a soft power toggle.
